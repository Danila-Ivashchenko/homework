Apple and pear trees were blooming,
Mists floated over the river.
Katyusha went ashore,
On the high bank on the steep.

Went out, started a song
About the steppe grey eagle,
About the one I loved,
About the one whose letters I was saving.

Oh, you, a song, a girl's song,
You fly after the clear sun:
And a fighter on the far frontier
Say hello from Katyusha.

Let him remember a simple girl,
Let him hear her sing,
Let him protect his native land,
And Katyusha will save love.

Apple and pear trees were blooming,
Mists floated over the river.
Katyusha went ashore,
On the high bank on the steep.
